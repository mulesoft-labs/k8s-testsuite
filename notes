Hello everyone!
today Tariq and I will be giving you a sneak peek of the The Core PaaS service mesh.
The Core PaaS Service mesh which is built on top of istio is going to add tons of network features for teams.
mTLS, rate limiting, transaction tracing and more can all be configured quickly and easily
And the best part? there are no application code changes required!

Hey that is a lot of buzzwords how about you tell them how it works?
----
The mesh works by automatically attaching a loyal sidecar to your service.
This sidecar is configured to intercept all outgoing and incoming traffic via iptables.

And this traffic can be configured easily via yaml files using our existing helm tooling.

For example: If you wanted to try out rate limiting. You simply create an object kind: EnvoyFilter apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3 â€¦
=
YOOO, how about we just show them?
=
Haha Oo yea, good idea!



Server / client prints headers
sidecar
curl istio-demo-server

a big feature show mTLS

vim helm/templates/mtls.yaml

* headers
vim helm/templates/features.yaml

Not a fan of cats

T: Nice, party tricks

And this is just a small sample of what the service mesh will be able to do with any application changes.
